# Aptos Arcade ‚Äì On-chain Casual Games

## Project Description

Aptos Arcade is a revolutionary blockchain-based gaming platform that brings casual games directly onto the Aptos blockchain. This smart contract enables players to participate in on-chain games, track their performance, and earn rewards based on their achievements. The platform creates a transparent and decentralized gaming ecosystem where player statistics, high scores, and rewards are permanently recorded on the blockchain.

The smart contract manages player registrations, game sessions, scoring systems, and automatic reward distribution. Players pay a small fee to play games, which contributes to a shared prize pool that rewards high-achieving players, creating an engaging and competitive gaming environment.
